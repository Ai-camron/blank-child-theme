# —BLANK—

**Tagline:** Wear nothing loud.

## Overview
—BLANK— is a minimalist streetwear and lifestyle brand rooted in **digital code, silence, and modern expression**.  
It speaks through **absence**, challenging overdesigned norms by focusing on negative space, utility, and subtle symbolism.

## Philosophy
A study in minimalism as rebellion.  
Every design element exists with intent — or not at all.  
The void becomes identity. The error becomes language.

## Aesthetic
- Neutral tones anchored by a **signature yellow dot** — a spark of disruption  
- **Monospaced + serif** typographic duality  
- Influences from **terminal syntax**, HTML placeholders, and digital voids  
- **Flat, geometric** design layouts with structured rhythm  
- Accessibility and simplicity prioritized over noise

## Product Concepts
| Concept | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **NULL.** | Subtle embroidery on sleeve hems; a quiet signature. |
| **_blank()** | Oversized hoodie print — literal digital emptiness. |
| **[ NOT FOUND ]** | Label tag on canvas pouches; commentary on absence. |
| **404** | Minimal grey print across tote surfaces. |
| **#404040** | Hex-coded statement piece; tone-as-message. |

## Audience
- Creatives and tech-minded minimalists  
- Designers who see silence as design  
- Individuals seeking **gender-neutral**, **size-diverse**, understated wear  
- Those drawn to irony and conceptual fashion

## Visual Tokens
| Element | Specification |
|----------|----------------|
| **Primary Palette** | #FFFFFF, #000000, #404040, #ECECEC, **Yellow Dot Accent (#FFD300)** |
| **Typography** | Monospace (e.g. IBM Plex Mono) + Transitional Serif (e.g. Playfair Display) |
| **Logo Mark** | —BLANK— wordmark with placeholder dash, full-caps or lowercase variants |
| **Labeling** | Digital syntax-inspired identifiers (e.g. `[void]`, `<null>`, `//blank`) |

## Brand Usage
- Never overcrowd space. Treat emptiness as part of composition.  
- Avoid overbranding; placement should feel algorithmic, not decorative.  
- Maintain **WCAG contrast** and responsive layout principles for all visuals.  
- Minimal color per piece. Texture or typography acts as the design itself.  

## Production Notes
- Preferred materials: cotton blends, canvas, muted synthetics  
- Embroidery and single-tone screen prints only  
- Packaging: recycled matte black or white boxes, single yellow dot seal  
- Label includes website and collection code in monospaced text
